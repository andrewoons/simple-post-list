# simple-post-lists

Wordpress plugin that generates a really simple post list, divided by year.

## How to use

After activating the plugin, place the [posts] shortcode anywhere you want the plugin to appear (page, post, widget etc..)

## Customizing

You can change the styling of the dividers and the links by adding custom css for these classes: `posts-divider` and `posts-link`.

## Bugs
